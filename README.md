# Whoops!

This thing's got some problems!

Here is a list of bugs we know about!

1. The contact us page is showing not found

- (hows you fix this?) The route was showing /contact in the index.jsx file when it should have been showing /contact-us as it shows in the NavBar component!

2. The Home page should have a Header that says "Welcome Home", but it's not in there!

- (hows you fix this?) The setTitlePage did not have Welcome Home inside of it so it was as simple as adding it in!

3. There should be a list of topics rendering on the about page!

- (hows you fix this?)

4. There is also something that's crashing the app right away!?

There's a few other ones in there we haven't documented!
